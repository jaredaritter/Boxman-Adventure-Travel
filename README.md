* Static, hard coded page using only HTML and CSS
* Skills application of prior learning in real world example
* Personal thoughts: 
    * I am quickly seeing the value of templates, libraries, frameworks, and databases when refactoring this project. Even making use of multiline editing tools, having to edit multiple lines of hard coded HTML is frustratingly slow and tedious. This is a valuable lesson in why DRYing tools are used. This is most definitely the hard way.
